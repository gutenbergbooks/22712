    </p>
    <p>
      The 25th of May, 1866, was no doubt to many a quite indifferent date, but
      to two persons it was the saddest day of their lives. Charles Randall that
      day left Bonn, Germany, to catch the steamer home to America, and Ida
      Werner was left with a mountain of grief on her gentle bosom, which must
      be melted away drop by drop, in tears, before she could breathe freely
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year before, Randall, hunting for apartments, his last term at the
      university just begun, had seen the announcement, &ldquo;<i>Zimmer zu vermiethen</i>,&rdquo;
       in the hall below the flat where the Werners lived. Ida answered his ring,
      for her father was still at his government office, and her mother had gone
      out to the market to buy the supper. She would much rather her mother had
      been at home to show the gentleman the rooms; but, knowing that they could
      not afford to lose a chance to rent them, she plucked up courage, and,
      candle in hand, showed him through the suite. When he came next day with
      his baggage, he learned for the first time what manner of apartments he
      had engaged; for although he had protracted the investigation the previous
      evening to the furthest corner, and had been most exacting as to
      explanations, he had really rented the rooms entirely on account of a
      certain light in which a set of Madonna features, in auburn hair, had
      shown at the first opening of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed since this, and a week ago a letter from home had stated
      that his father, indignant at his unexplained stay six months beyond the
      end of his course, had sent him one last remittance, barely sufficient for
      a steamer ticket, with the intimation that if he did not return on a set
      day, he must thenceforth attend to his own exchequer. The 25th was the
      last day on which he could leave Bonn to catch the requisite steamer. Had
      it been in November, nature at least would have sympathized; it was cruel
      that their autumn time of separation should fall in the spring, when the
      sky is full of bounteous promise and the earth of blissful trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love is so improvident that a parting a year away is no more feared than
      death, and a month&rsquo;s end seems dim and distant. But a week,&mdash;a week
      only,&mdash;that even to love is short, and the beginning of the end. The
      chilling mist that rose from the gulf of separation so near before them
      overshadowed all the brief remnant of their path. They were constantly
      together. But a silence had come upon them. Never had words seemed idler,
      they had so much to say. They could say nothing that did not mock the
      weight on their hearts, and seem trivial and impertinent because it was
      exclusive of more important matter. The utmost they could do was to lay
      their hearts open toward each other to receive every least impression of
      voice, and look, and manner, to be remembered afterward. At evening they
      went into the minster church, and, sitting in the shadows, listened to the
      sweet, shrill choir of boys whose music distilled the honey of sorrow; and
      as the deep bass organ chords gripped their hearts with the tones that
      underlie all weal and woe, they looked in each other&rsquo;s eyes, and did for a
      space feel so near that all the separation that could come after seemed
      but a trifling thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all arranged between them. He was to earn money, or get a position
      in business, and return in a year or two at most and bring her to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said once, &ldquo;if I could but sleep till thou comest again to wake
      me, how blessed I should be; but, alas, I must wake all through the
      desolate time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although for the most part she comforted him rather than he her, yet at
      times she gave way, and once suddenly turned to him and hid her face on
      his breast, and said, trembling with tearless sobs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I shall never see thee more, Karl. Thou wilt forget me in thy
      great, far land and wilt love another. My heart tells me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she raised her head, and her streaming eyes blazed with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hover about thee, and if thou lovest another, I will kill her as
      she sleeps by thy side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the woman must have loved him much who, after seeing that look of
      hers, would have married him. But a moment after she was listening with
      abject ear to his promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came at last. He was to leave at three o&rsquo;clock. After the noontide
      meal, Ida&rsquo;s mother sat with them and they talked a little about America,
      Frau Werner exerting herself to give a cheerful tone to the conversation,
      and Randall answering her questions absently and without taking his eyes
      off Ida, who felt herself beginning to be seized with a nervous trembling.
      At last Frau Werner rose and silently left the room, looking back at them
      as she closed the door with eyes full of tears. Then, as if by a common
      impulse, they rose and put their arms about each other&rsquo;s necks, and their
      lips met in a long, shuddering kiss. The breath came quicker and quicker;
      sobs broke the kisses; tears poured down and made them salt and bitter, as
      parting kisses should be in which sweetness is mockery. Hitherto they had
      controlled their feelings, or rather she had controlled him; but it was no
      use any longer, for the time had come, and they abandoned themselves to
      the terrible voluptuousness of unrestrained grief, in which there is a
      strange, meaningless suggestion of power, as though it might possibly be a
      force that could affect or remove its own cause if but wild and strong
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Randall, the carriage waits and you will lose the train,&rdquo; said Frau
      Werner from the door, in a husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go, by God!&rdquo; he swore, as he felt her clasp convulsively
      strengthen at the summons. The lesser must yield to the greater, and no
      loss or gain on earth was worth the grief upon her face. His father might
      disinherit him, America might sink, but she must smile again. And she did,&mdash;brave,
      true girl and lover. The devotion his resolute words proved was like a
      strong nervine to restore her self-control. She smiled as well as her
      trembling lips would let her, and said, as she loosed him from her arms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thou must go, Karl. But thou wilt return, <i>nicht wahr?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would not venture to say how many times he rushed to the door, and,
      glancing back at her as she stood there desolate, followed his glance once
      more to her side. Finally, Frau Werner led him as one dazed to the
      carriage, and the impatient driver drove off at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is seven years later, and Randall is pacing the deck of an ocean
      steamer, outward bound from New York. It is the evening of the first day
      out. Here and there passengers are leaning over the bulwarks, pensively
      regarding the sinking sun as it sets for the first time between them and
      their native land, or maybe taking in with awed faces the wonder of the
      deep, which has haunted their imaginations from childhood. Others are
      already busily striking up acquaintances with fellow-passengers, and a
      bridal pair over yonder sit thrilling with the sense of isolation from the
      world that so emphasizes their mutual dependence and all-importance to
      each other. And other groups are talking business, and referring to money
      and markets in New York, London, and Frankfort as glibly as if they were
      on land, much to the secret shock of certain raw tourists, who marvel at
      the in-sensitiveness of men who, thus speeding between two worlds, and
      freshly in the presence of the most august and awful form of nature, can
      keep their minds so steadily fixed upon cash-books and ledgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Randall, as, with the habit of an old voyager, he already falls to
      pacing the deck, is too much engrossed with his own thoughts to pay much
      heed to these things. Only, as he passes a group of Germans, and the
      familiar accents of the sweet, homely tongue fall on his ear, he pauses,
      and lingers near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness gathers, the breeze freshens, the waves come tumbling out of
      the east, and the motion of the ship increases as she rears upward to meet
      them. The groups on deck are thinning out fast, as the passengers go below
      to enjoy the fearsome novelty of the first night at sea, and to compose
      themselves to sleep as it were in the hollow of God&rsquo;s hand. But long into
      the night Randall&rsquo;s cigar still marks his pacing up and down as he
      ponders, with alternations of tender, hopeful glow and sad foreboding, the
      chances of his quest. Will he find her?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to go back a little. When Randall reached America on his
      return from Germany, he immediately began to sow his wild oats, and gave
      his whole mind to it. Answering Ida&rsquo;s letters got to be a bore, and he
      gradually ceased doing it. Then came a few sad reproaches from her, and
      their correspondence ceased. Meanwhile, having had his youthful fling, he
      settled down as a steady young man of business. One day he was surprised
      to observe that he had of late insensibly fallen into the habit of
      thinking a good deal in a pensive sort of way about Ida and those German
      days. The notion occurred to him that he would hunt up her picture, which
      he had not thought of in five years. With misty eyes and crowding memories
      he pored over it, and a wave of regretful, yearning tenderness filled his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night, after long search, he found among his papers a bundle of
      her old letters, already growing yellow. Being exceedingly rusty in his
      German, he had to study them out word by word. That night, till the sky
      grew gray in the east, he sat there turning the pages of the dictionary
      with wet eyes and glowing face, and selecting definitions by the test of
      the heart. He found that some of these letters he had never before taken
      the pains to read through. In the bitterness of his indignation, he cursed
      the fool who had thrown away a love so loyal and priceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time he had been thinking of Ida as if dead, so far off in
      another world did those days seem. It was with extraordinary effect that
      the idea finally flashed upon him that she was probably alive, and now in
      the prime of her beauty. After a period of feverish and impassioned
      excitement, he wrote a letter full of wild regret and beseeching, and an
      ineffable tenderness. Then he waited. After a long time it came back from
      the German dead-letter office. There was no person of the name at the
      address. She had left Bonn, then. Hastily setting his affairs in order, he
      sailed for Germany on the next steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incidents of the voyage were a blank in his mind. On reaching Bonn, he
      went straight from the station to the old house in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;strasse.
      As he turned into it from the scarcely less familiar streets leading
      thither, and noted each accustomed landmark, he seemed to have just
      returned to tea from an afternoon lecture at the university. In every
      feature of the street some memory lurked, and, as he passed, threw out
      delaying tendrils, clutching at his heart. Rudely he broke away, hastening
      on to that house near the end of the street, in each of whose quaint
      windows fancy framed the longed-for face. She was not there, he knew, but
      for a while he stood on the other side of the street, unmindful of the
      stares and jostling of the passers-by, gazing at the house-front, and
      letting himself imagine from moment to moment that her figure might flit
      across some window, or issue from the door, basket in hand, for the
      evening marketing, on which journey he had so often accompanied her. At
      length, crossing the street, he inquired for the Werner family. The
      present tenants had never heard the name. Perhaps the tenants from whom
      they had received the house might be better informed. Where were they?
      They had moved to Cologne. He next went to the Bonn police-office, and
      from the records kept there, in which pretty much everything about every
      citizen is set down, ascertained that several years previous Herr Werner
      had died of apoplexy, and that no one of the name was now resident in the
      city. Next day he went to Cologne, hunted up the former tenants of the
      house, and found that they remembered quite distinctly the Werner family,
      and the death of the father and only breadwinner. It had left the mother
      and daughter quite without resources, as Randall had known must probably
      have been the case. His informants had heard that they had gone to
      Dusseldorf.
    </p>
    <p>
      His search had become a fever. After waiting seven years, a delay of ten
      minutes was unendurable. The trains seemed to creep. And yet, on reaching
      Diisseldorf, he did not at once go about his search, but said to himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me not risk the killing of my last hope till I have warmed myself
      with it one more night, for to-morrow there may be no more warmth in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to a hotel, ordered a room and a bottle of wine, and sat over it
      all night, indulging the belief that he would find her the next day. He
      denied his imagination nothing, but conjured up before his mind&rsquo;s eye the
      lovely vision of her fairest hour, complete even to the turn of the neck,
      the ribbon in the hair, and the light in the blue eyes. So he would turn
      into the street. Yes, here was the number. Then he rings the bell. She
      comes to the door. She regards him a moment indifferently. Then amazed
      recognition, love, happiness, transfigure her face. &ldquo;Ida!&rdquo; &ldquo;Karl!&rdquo; and he
      clasps her sobbing to his bosom, from which she shall never be sundered
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his search next day was the discovery that mother and
      daughter had been at Diisseldorf until about four years previous, where
      the mother had died of consumption, and the daughter had removed, leaving
      no address. The lodgings occupied by them were of a wretched character,
      showing that their circumstances must have been very much reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now no further clue to guide his search. It was destined that
      the last he was to know of her should be that she was thrown on the tender
      mercies of the world,&mdash;her last friend gone, her last penny expended.
      She was buried out of his sight, not in the peaceful grave, with its
      tender associations, but buried alive in the living world; hopelessly hid
      in the huge, writhing confusion of humanity. He lingered in the folly of
      despair about those sordid lodgings in Diisseldorf, as one might circle
      vainly about the spot in the ocean where some pearl of great price had
      fallen overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he roused again, and began putting advertisements for Ida
      into the principal newspapers of Germany, and making random visits to
      towns all about to consult directories and police records. A singular sort
      of misanthropy possessed him. He cursed the multitude of towns and
      villages that reduced the chances in his favor to so small a thing. He
      cursed the teeming throngs of men, women, and children, in whose mass she
      was lost, as a jewel in a mountain of rubbish. Had he possessed the power,
      he would in those days, without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, have swept the
      bewildering, obstructing millions of Germany out of existence, as the
      miner washes away the earth to bring to light the grain of gold in his
      pan. He must have scanned a million women&rsquo;s faces in that weary search,
      and the bitterness of that million-fold disappointment left its trace in a
      feeling of aversion for the feminine countenance and figure that he was
      long in overcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that only by some desperate chance he could hope to meet her in
      his random wanderings, it seemed to him that he was more likely to be
      successful by resigning as far as possible all volition, and leaving the
      guidance of the search to chance; as if Fortune were best disposed toward
      those who most entirely abdicated intelligence and trusted themselves to
      her. He sacredly followed every impulse, never making up his mind an hour
      before at what station he should leave the cars, and turning to the right
      or left in his wanderings through the streets of cities, as much as
      possible without intellectual choice. Sometimes, waking suddenly in the
      middle of the night, he would rise, dress with eager haste, and sally out
      to wander through the dark streets, thinking he might be led of Providence
      to meet her. And, once out, nothing but utter exhaustion could drive him
      back; for how could he tell but in the moment after he had gone, she might
      pass? He had recourse to every superstition of sortilege, clairvoyance,
      presentiment, and dreams. And all the time his desperation was singularly
      akin to hope. He dared revile no seeming failure, not knowing but just
      that was the necessary link in the chain of accidents destined to bring
      him face to face with her. The darkest hour might usher in the sunburst.
      The possibility that this was at last the blessed chance lit up his eyes
      ten thousand times as they fell on some new face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last he found himself back in Bonn, with the feverish infatuation
      of the gambler, which had succeeded hope in his mind, succeeded in turn by
      utter despair! His sole occupation now was revisiting the spots which he
      had frequented with her in that happy year. As one who has lost a princely
      fortune sits down at length to enumerate the little items of property that
      happen to be attached to his person, disregarded before but now his all,
      so Randall counted up like a miser the little store of memories that were
      thenceforth to be his all. Wonderfully, the smallest details of those days
      came back to him. The very seats they sat in at public places, the shops
      they entered together, their promenades and the pausing-places on them,
      revived in memory under a concentrated inward gaze like invisible
      paintings brought over heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, after wandering about the city for some hours, he turned
      into a park to rest. As he approached his usual bench, sacred to him
      because Ida and he in the old days had often sat there, he was annoyed to
      see it already occupied by a pleasant-faced, matronly looking German
      woman, who was complacently listening to the chatter of a couple of small
      children. Randall threw himself upon the unoccupied end of the bench,
      rather hoping that his gloomy and preoccupied air might cause them to
      depart and leave him to his melancholy reverie. And, indeed, it was not
      long before the children stopped their play and gathered timidly about
      their mother, and soon after the bench tilted slightly as she relieved it
      of her substantial charms, saying in a cheery, pleasant voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, little ones, the father will be at home before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a secluded part of the garden, and the plentiful color left her
      cheeks as the odd gentleman at the other end of the bench turned with a
      great start at the sound of her voice, and transfixed her with a
      questioning look. But in a moment he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madame, a thousand times. The sound of your voice so reminded
      me of a friend I have lost that I looked up involuntarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman responded with good-natured assurances that he had not at all
      alarmed her. Meanwhile Randall had an opportunity to notice that, in spite
      of the thick-waisted and generally matronly figure, there were, now he
      came to look closely, several rather marked resemblances to Ida. The eyes
      were of the same blue tint, though about half as large, the cheeks being
      twice as full. In spite of the ugly style of dressing it, he saw also that
      the hair was like Ida&rsquo;s; and as for the nose, that feature which changes
      least, it might have been taken out of Ida&rsquo;s own face. As may be supposed,
      he was thoroughly disgusted to be reminded of that sweet girlish vision by
      this broadly moulded, comfortable-looking matron. His romantic mood was
      scattered for that evening at least, and he knew he should not get the
      prosaic suggestions of the unfortunate resemblance out of his mind for a
      week at least. It would torment him as a humorous association spoils a
      sacred hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed with rather an ill grace, and was about to retire, when a certain
      peculiar turn of the neck, as the lady acknowledged his salute, caught his
      eye and turned him to stone. Good God! this woman was Ida!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there in a condition of mental paralysis. The whole fabric of his
      thinking and feeling for months of intense emotional experience had
      instantly been annihilated, and he was left in the midst of a great void
      in his consciousness out of touching-reach of anything. There was no sharp
      pang, but just a bewildered numbness. A few filaments only of the romantic
      feeling for Ida that filled his mind a moment before still lingered,
      floating about it, unattached to anything, like vague neuralgic feelings
      in an amputated stump, as if to remind him of what had been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was as instantaneous as a galvanic shock the moment he had
      recognized&mdash;let us not say Ida, but this evidence that she was no
      more. It occurred to him that the woman, who stood staring, was in common
      politeness entitled to some explanation. He was in just that state of mind
      when, the only serious interest having suddenly dropped out of the life,
      the minor conventionalities loom up as peculiarly important and
      obligatory.
    </p>

      &ldquo;You were Fraiilein Ida Werner, and lived at No.&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;strasse
      in 1866, <i>nicht wahr?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a cold, dead tone, as if making a necessary but distasteful
      explanation to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, truly,&rdquo; replied the woman curiously; &ldquo;but my name is now Frau
      Stein,&rdquo; glancing at the children, who had been staring open-mouthed at the
      queer man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember Karl Randall? I am he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most formal of old acquaintances could hardly have recalled himself in
      a more indifferent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Herr Gott im Himmel!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the woman, with the liveliest
      surprise and interest &ldquo;Karl! Is it possible? Yes, now I recognize you.
      Surely! surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clapped one hand to her bosom, and dropped on the bench to recover
      herself. Fleshy people, overcome by agitation, are rather disagreeable
      objects. Randall stood looking at her with a singular expression of
      aversion on his listless face. But, after panting a few times, the woman
      recovered her vivacity and began to ply him vigorously with exclamations
      and questions, beaming the while with delighted interest. He answered her
      like a schoolboy, too destitute of presence of mind to do otherwise than
      to yield passively to her impulse. But he made no inquiries whatever of
      her, and did not distantly allude to the reason of his presence in
      Germany. As he stood there looking at her, the real facts about that
      matter struck him as so absurd and incredible that he could not believe
      them himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon he observed that she was becoming a little conscious in her
      air, and giving a slightly sentimental turn to the conversation. It was
      not for some time that he saw her drift, so utterly without connection in
      his mind were Ida and this comfortable matron before him; and when he did,
      a smile at the exquisite absurdity of the thing barely twitched the
      corners of his mouth, and ended in a sad, puzzled stare that rather put
      the other out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the children had now for some time been whimpering for supper and
      home, and at length Frau Stein rose, and, with an urgent request that
      Randall should call on her and see her husband, bade him a cordial adieu.
      He stood there watching her out of sight, with an unconscious smile of the
      most refined and subtle cynicism. Then he sat down and stared vacantly at
      the close-cropped grass on the opposite side of the path. By what handle
      should he lay hold of his thoughts?
    </p>
    <p>
      That woman could not retroact and touch the memory of Ida. That dear
      vision remained intact. He drew forth his locket, and opening it gazed
      passionately at the fair girlish face, now so hopelessly passed away. By
      that blessed picture he could hold her and defy the woman. Remembering
      that fat, jolly, comfortable matron, he should not at least ever again
      have to reproach himself with his cruel treatment of Ida. And yet why not?
      What had the woman to do with her? She had suffered as much as if the
      woman had not forgotten it all. His reckoning was with Ida,&mdash;was with
      her. Where should he find her? In what limbo could he imagine her? Ah,
      that was the wildering cruelty of it. She was not this woman, nor was she
      dead in any conceivable natural way so that her girlish spirit might have
      remained eternally fixed. She was nothing. She was nowhere. She existed
      only in this locket, and her only soul was in his heart, far more surely
      than in this woman who had forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death was a hopeful, cheerful state compared to that nameless nothingness
      that was her portion. For had she been dead, he could still have loved her
      soul; but now she had none. The soul that once she had, and, if she had
      then died, might have kept, had been forfeited by living on, and had
      passed to this woman, and would from her pass on further till finally
      fixed and vested in the decrepitude of age by death. So, then, it was
      death and not life that secured the soul, and his sweet Ida had none
      because she had not died in time. Ah! had not he heard somewhere that the
      soul is immortal and never dies? Where, then, was Ida&rsquo;s? She had
      disappeared utterly out of the universe. She had been transformed,
      destroyed, swallowed up in this woman, a living sepulchre, more cruel than
      the grave, for it devoured the soul as well as the body. Pah! this prating
      about immortality was absurd, convicted of meaninglessness before a
      tragedy like this; for what was an immortality worth that was given to her
      last decrepit phase of life, after all its beauty and strength and
      loveliness had passed soulless away? To be aught but a mockery,
      immortality must be as manifold as the manifold phases of life. Since life
      devours so many souls, why suppose death will spare the last one?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would contend with destiny. Painters should multiply the face in
      his locket. He would immortalize her in a poem. He would constantly keep
      the lamp trimmed and burning before her shrine in his heart. She should
      live in spite of the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could now never make amends to her for the suffering his cruel,
      neglectful youth had caused her. He had scarcely realized before how much
      the longing to make good that wrong had influenced bis quest of her. Tears
      of remorse for an unatonable crime gathered in his eyes. He might, indeed,
      enrich this woman, or educate her children, or pension her husband; but
      that would be no atonement to Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as if to intensify that remorse by showing still more clearly
      the impossibility of atonement, it flashed on him that he who loved Ida
      was not the one to atone for an offense of which he would be incapable,
      which had been committed by one who despised her love. Justice was a
      meaningless word, and amends were never possible, nor can men ever make
      atonement; for, ere the debt is paid, the atonement made, one who is not
      the sufferer stands to receive it; while, on the other hand, the one who
      atones is not the offender, but one who comes after him, loathing his
      offense and himself incapable of it. The dead must bury their dead. And,
      thus pondering from personal to general thoughts, the turmoil of his
      feelings gradually calmed, and a restful melancholy, vague and tender,
      filled the aching void in his heart.
